## Project Highlights

This project stands out as a direct reflection of a developer's ability to build clean, functional, and visually appealing web interfaces that convey essential information effectively. It leverages modern frontend practices combined with a robust backend understanding (as evidenced by the listed tech stack) to create an engaging user experience.

## Usage

Accessing this interactive resume is straightforward. As it's primarily a static HTML file (generated via PHP for serving purposes), you can view it directly in your web browser.

To view the resume locally:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/apreezofficial/your-repo-name.git # Replace with actual repo name
    cd your-repo-name
    ```
2.  **Serve with a PHP development server (recommended for consistency):**
    ```bash
    php -S localhost:8000
    ```
    Then, open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000`.
3.  **Alternatively, open directly:**
    You can also simply open the `index.php` file in your preferred web browser. While this might not fully emulate a server environment, the static nature of the content ensures it renders correctly.

Once opened, feel free to navigate through the various sections: **Summary**, **Tech Stack**, **Featured Projects**, **Education**, and **Additional Info** to explore Precious Adedokun's professional journey and technical expertise.
